# Training a Neural Network to Predict Stock Prices

This project exploits a huge dataset containing stock prices for the S&P 500 Index and its constituents from April 2017 to August 2017 to precisely predict the next minute stock price of the S&P 500 Index. 
As the neural network is training and testing, a graph of the actual stock price and the predicted stock price will be plotted, moreover the error and accuracy will be calculated and displayed.
